# LowerCaseMe

A script I wrote as a bit of a personal project to replace uppercase text to lowercase text.

I found that i was getting a lot of text from a customer for website content that was in uppercase.

### Instructions

- Install requirements.txt
- Run the script `python3 run.py`
- Add your input text
- Copy and paste the output

Thats it.
