# LowerCaseMe

A script I wrote as a bit of a personal project to replace uppercase text to lowercase text.

I found that i was getting a lot of text from a customer for website content that was in uppercase.

### Instructions

- Add some uppercase text to the input file and `save.txt`
- Run the scrpt `python3 run.py`
- View the `output.txt` for the lowercased text

Thats it.
