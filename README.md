# LowerCaseMe

A script I wrote as a bit of a personal project to replace uppercase text to lowercase text.

I found that I was getting a lot of text from a customer for website content that was in uppercase.

###  TODO:

- ~~Refactor~~
- Put the uppercase at the start of sentence.


### Instructions

- Install requirements.txt
- Run the script `python3 main.py`
- Add your input text
- Copy and paste the output

#### Extras
If you spend a bit of time in the terminal, then add it to your aliases or edit as you need.
